domains-acknowledged:
  ADR-043: Predates ADR-043; feature command adapters were written before the slice+adapter pattern was formalised and are not retroactively refactored.
  ADR-040: predates ADR-040; feature ships independently of the unified verify / LLM-boundary pipeline
  ADR-041: Pre-dates ADR-041; this feature does not author absence TCs or set removes/deprecates on ADRs. FT-047 owns the mechanics.
  ADR-042: Pre-dates ADR-042; this feature does not define TC types or validate the type vocabulary. FT-048 owns the mechanics.
  ADR-018: Predates the 2026-04-22 scope promotion of ADR-018 to cross-cutting. Test coverage reflects the property/session/benchmark strategy as it existed when this feature shipped; not retroactively reclassified.

`product impact` performs reverse-graph reachability analysis to show the full affected set when an artifact changes.

```
product impact ADR-002    # full affected set if this decision changes
product impact FT-001     # what depends on this feature completing
product impact TC-003     # what depends on this test criterion
```

Impact analysis traverses all five edge types in reverse to find every artifact reachable from the target. The output lists affected features, ADRs, and test criteria grouped by hop distance.

This is used by:
- ADR supersession (auto-triggered when `product adr status ADR-XXX superseded` is called)
- Pre-implementation review (`product implement` step 2 references impact for drift context)
- Manual change assessment before modifying shared decisions
