**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** `product migrate from-prd` and `product migrate from-adrs` were listed in the phase plan without specification. These are the highest-risk commands in Product: they read freeform markdown prose and write many new files based on heuristic parsing. Unlike all other Product commands, they produce artifacts that require human review — the parser cannot determine intent with certainty from unstructured input.

The migration command must be specified completely before implementation: what heuristics it uses, what output it produces, what rollback story exists, and how the developer confirms and corrects the output.

**Decision:** Migration is a two-phase process: **extraction** (parse the source document, propose a set of artifacts) then **confirmation** (developer reviews and commits). No files are written until the developer explicitly confirms. Extraction is deterministic given a document; there is no ambiguous state. All extracted artifacts are written atomically as a batch.

---

### Supported Source Documents

**`product migrate from-prd SOURCE.md`** — parses a monolithic PRD document. Detects features from heading structure.

**`product migrate from-adrs SOURCE.md`** — parses a monolithic ADR document. Detects individual ADRs and extracts test criteria from ADR subsections.

Both commands accept `--validate` for dry-run output without writing files.

---

### Extraction Heuristics: PRD → Features

The parser scans for H2 (`##`) headings that match feature-like patterns. A heading is treated as a feature boundary if it:
- Is at H2 level
- Does not match a set of known non-feature headings: `Vision`, `Goals`, `Non-Goals`, `Target Environment`, `Core Architecture`, `Open Questions`, `Resolved Decisions`, `Phase Plan`, `Overview`, `Introduction`, `Background`, `References`

For each candidate feature heading:
- `title` is the heading text, stripped of leading numbers and punctuation (`## 5. Products and IAM` → `Products and IAM`)
- `phase` is inferred from the nearest preceding `### Phase N` heading, or 1 if none found
- `status` is `planned` by default
- `depends-on` is empty — not inferred (requires human judgment)
- `adrs` and `tests` are empty — not linked (requires `product graph check` to identify gaps)

The body of the section (all content until the next H2) becomes the feature file body.

**Checklist inference:** If the source PRD contains a checklist section (lines matching `- [ ]` or `- [x]`), checked items set the corresponding feature `status` to `complete`, unchecked items remain `planned`. This handles migration from an existing `checklist.md`.

---

### Extraction Heuristics: ADRs → ADR Files + Test Criteria

The parser scans for H2 (`##`) headings matching the pattern `ADR-NNN:` or `## ADR-NNN`.

For each ADR:
- `id` is extracted from the heading prefix
- `title` is the heading text after the prefix
- `status` is extracted from a `**Status:**` line in the body (`Accepted`, `Proposed`, etc.)
- `supersedes` and `superseded-by` are extracted from `**Supersedes:**` / `**Superseded By:**` lines
- `features` is empty — not inferred

**Test criteria extraction:** Within each ADR body, the parser looks for subsections matching these heading patterns:
- `
### Output Format (Dry-Run and Confirmation)

`product migrate from-adrs picloud-adrs.md --validate` produces:

```
Migration plan: picloud-adrs.md → 9 ADRs, 34 test criteria

ADR files to create:
  docs/adrs/ADR-001-rust-language.md                (status: accepted)
  docs/adrs/ADR-002-openraft-consensus.md            (status: accepted)
  ... (7 more)

Test criteria files to create:
  docs/tests/TC-001-binary-compiles.md               (type: exit-criteria, adr: ADR-001)
  docs/tests/TC-002-raft-leader-election.md           (type: scenario, adr: ADR-002)
  ... (32 more)

Warnings:
  [W008] ADR-003: status not found, defaulting to "proposed"
  [W009] ADR-007: no test subsection found — no test criteria extracted

Conflicts:
  docs/adrs/ADR-001-rust-language.md already exists — will skip (use --overwrite to replace)

Run without --validate to create these files.
Run with --interactive for per-artifact confirmation.
```

### Execution Modes

**`--validate`** (default safe mode) — prints the migration plan and exits. No files written.

**`--execute`** — writes all proposed files. Skips files that already exist. Reports skipped files.

**`--overwrite`** — writes all proposed files. Overwrites files that already exist. Requires explicit confirmation prompt unless `--yes` is also passed.

**`--interactive`** — for each proposed artifact, prints the proposed front-matter and first 200 characters of body, then prompts: `[a]ccept / [e]dit / [s]kip / [q]uit`. `edit` opens the proposed content in `$EDITOR`. This mode is recommended for first migration of a large document.

---

### Rollback

Migration writes files atomically (ADR-015). If any write fails mid-batch, the error is reported and the remaining files are not written. Already-written files are not rolled back — they are valid artifact files. The developer can delete them manually or run migration again with `--overwrite`.

`product migrate` never modifies the source document. The source PRD and ADR files are read-only inputs.

`product migrate` never modifies `product.toml` or `checklist.md`. These are updated by `product checklist generate` after migration.

---

### Post-Migration Workflow

After migration, the recommended workflow is:

```bash
product migrate from-adrs picloud-adrs.md --execute
product migrate from-prd picloud-prd.md --execute
product graph check          # surfaces all broken links (features with no ADRs, etc.)
# manually add feature→ADR links based on graph check output
product feature link FT-001 --adr ADR-001 --adr ADR-002  # repeat per feature
product graph check          # should now exit 0 or 2 (warnings only)
product migrate link-tests   # infer TC→Feature links transitively through ADR links
product graph check          # W002 warnings reduce significantly
product checklist generate
```

`product graph check` after migration will always produce warnings (W001 orphaned ADRs, W002 features with no tests, etc.) because feature→ADR link edges require manual review. The developer fills these in using `product feature link`. Once feature→ADR links are confirmed, `product migrate link-tests` infers the transitive TC→Feature links automatically — see ADR-027.

---

**Rationale:**
- Two-phase extraction → confirmation prevents the most dangerous failure mode: writing 40 files and discovering the heuristics got 10 of them wrong. With `--validate`, the developer sees the full plan before committing.
- `--interactive` mode is the recommended path for a first migration. It forces a review of each artifact, which is valuable because the developer catches heuristic errors and also re-familiarises themselves with the content as it is being structured.
- Not inferring `depends-on` edges or feature→ADR links is correct. These relationships require semantic understanding of the content, not pattern matching on structure. Guessing wrong would be worse than leaving them empty.
- Preserving the source document unchanged means migration can be re-run safely if the first attempt was wrong. The source is always the ground truth.

**Rejected alternatives:**
- **Infer feature→ADR links from ADR body mentions of feature names** — too fragile. ADR prose mentions feature concepts by name but not by ID. Mismatches would require more cleanup than just linking manually.
- **Write all files immediately, provide `product migrate undo`** — rollback is complex in a file system context. The `--validate` → `--execute` two-phase approach achieves the same safety without requiring an undo log.
- **LLM-assisted migration** — use an LLM to interpret the PRD and generate structured artifacts. Would produce higher-quality extraction for ambiguous documents. Rejected for v1: Product must work without network access or API keys. Can be added as `product migrate --ai` in a future version.

**Test coverage:**

Scenario tests:
- `migrate_prd_heading_detection.rs` — parse a PRD with 5 H2 sections, 2 of which are `Goals` and `Non-Goals` (excluded). Assert exactly 3 feature files are proposed.
- `migrate_prd_phase_inference.rs` — parse a PRD with `### Phase 1` and `### Phase 2` headings. Assert features under each phase heading get the correct `phase` value.
- `migrate_prd_checklist_status.rs` — parse a PRD with a checklist section where 3 items are checked. Assert the 3 corresponding feature files have `status: complete`.
- `migrate_adrs_id_extraction.rs` — parse an ADR file with `## ADR-001: Rust` and `## ADR-002: openraft`. Assert exactly 2 ADR files are proposed with IDs `ADR-001` and `ADR-002`.
- `migrate_adrs_test_extraction.rs` — parse an ADR with a `### Test coverage` subsection containing 4 bullet points. Assert 4 test criterion files are proposed with `validates.adrs: [ADR-XXX]`.
- `migrate_adrs_test_type_inference.rs` — assert bullets containing "chaos" produce `type: chaos`, bullets containing "invariant" produce `type: invariant`, and others produce `type: scenario`.
- `migrate_validate_no_write.rs` — run `product migrate from-prd --validate`. Assert zero files are created in the repository.
- `migrate_execute_skips_existing.rs` — create `ADR-001-rust-language.md` before running migration. Assert the file is skipped and the skip is reported. Assert the original file content is unchanged.
- `migrate_interactive_skip.rs` — run `product migrate --interactive`, respond `s` (skip) to all prompts. Assert zero files are created.
- `migrate_source_unchanged.rs` — run `product migrate from-prd PRD.md --execute`. Assert the source `PRD.md` is byte-for-byte identical before and after the command.
- `migrate_picloud_prd.rs` — integration test: run migration against the actual PiCloud PRD. Assert at least 10 feature files are created. Assert `product graph check` exits with 2 (warnings) not 1 (errors) after migration (no broken links, only coverage gaps).
